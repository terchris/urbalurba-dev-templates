# Designsystemet Basic React App

File: templates/designsystemet-basic-react-app/README-designsystemet-basic-react-app.md

This is a simple React application template that integrates the [Designsystemet](https://github.com/digdir/designsystemet) from Digdir to create a blog page. The template displays a list of blog posts as cards, each with a title, excerpt, date, and an image, sourced from a JSON file.

Screenshot of the simple blog page:

## Purpose

The purpose of this template is to provide a minimal starting point for developers who want to build a blog page using Designsystemet's components and styling. It demonstrates how to set up a React/Vite app with Designsystemet, use its components (e.g., Card, Heading, Paragraph), and structure data for a blog using a JSON file.

## Features

- Blog page displaying posts as cards with images, titles, excerpts, and dates.
- Uses Designsystemet's CSS and React components for consistent, accessible UI.
- Data sourced from a `blog-posts.json` file for easy content updates.
- Built with Vite and React for fast development and modern tooling.
- TypeScript support for type-safe development.
- Inter font integration as recommended by Designsystemet.

## Prerequisites

The devcontainer-toolbox sets up everything you need to run this project locally.
See the repo https://github.com/norwegianredcross/devcontainer-toolbox on how to set it up.
When you have the devcontainer-toolbox set up, you type the following command in your terminal:

```bash
.devcontainer/dev/dev-template.sh
```

Then you select this template from the list:

```

## Getting Started

Once you have installed the template you are ready to start developing.

Run the following commands to build and run the server locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

You will see the following output:

```plaintext
